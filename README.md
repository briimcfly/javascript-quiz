## Reflection 
This project has allowed me to apply the core skills I have recently learned and put them into practice. During development, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of the localStorage property, setInterval method, and Object Arrays . Additionally, I developed a deeper appreciation for for the importance code commenting, and the development principal DRY. (Don't repeat yourself). In the future, I would like to spend more time improving the design of the page.
